```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Check our current repos with:

```{r}
options('repos')
```

Check your OS with:

``` bash
cat /etc/os-release
```

Set it to point at a single repository:

```{r}
# Set it to package manager
options(repos = c(RSPM = "https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/__linux__/jammy/latest"))

# Set it back to Cloud CRAN
options(repos = c(RSPM = "https://cloud.r-project.org"))
```

Pointing at multiple repos is also supported, where a package is looked for in the first repo in the list and if not found then later repos will be searched:

```{r}
options(repos = c(
  CRAN_RSPM = "https://colorado.rstudio.com/rspm/cran/__linux__/focal/2022-06-29",
  Internal = "https://colorado.rstudio.com/rspm/internal/__linux__/focal/latest",
  binary = "https://packagemanager.rstudio.com/all/__linux__/focal/latest",
  source = "https://packagemanager.rstudio.com/all/latest",
  CRAN = "https://cloud.r-project.org"
))
```

A particular repo can be set by the administrator in Workbench/Connect to be used by default:

-   [Workbench](https://docs.rstudio.com/rspm/admin/rstudio-server/)
-   [Connect](https://docs.rstudio.com/rsc/integration/rspm/)

Install an internal package:

```{r}
install.packages("archer")
```

Remove a package:

```{r}
remove.packages("archer")
```

Internal packages can be uploaded by an administrator or through the CLI (requires admin access), or through [CI/CD](https://github.com/rstudio/package-manager-demo/blob/main/.github/workflows/package-manager-demo.yml) with the [remote cli](https://docs.rstudio.com/rspm/admin/admin-cli/#cli-remote-use).

## Using the CLI to upload a package

Resources: - <https://positpbc.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PRO/pages/207880379/Remote+Publish+Pvt.+R+Package+from+Workbench+to+Package+Manager> - <https://github.com/rstudio/package-manager-demo/tree/main/r-package-manager-demo> - Changing the package name is hard: <https://community.rstudio.com/t/how-to-rename-an-r-package/85633/12>

The below is executed from the `PackageManagerDemo` project.

``` bash
env | grep PACKAGEMANAGER_SOURCE
```

Change name of tar file outputs so it doesn't match something on the server - this will be done in the DESCRIPTION file. Change the name and the version.

``` bash
R CMD build .

R CMD INSTALL --build .
```

Optional: `R CMD check .`

``` bash
rspm add --source=internally_published --path=lisaPackageManagerDemo_0.0.1.tar.gz

rspm add binary --source=internally_published --distribution=bionic --path=lisaPackageManagerDemo_0.0.1_R_x86_64-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz
```

You should now see lisaPackageManagerDemo in `published` in Package Manager.

From Colorado the `internally_published` source is publishing to `published`. We can connect to it to download our package with:

```{r}
#Connect only to the internally_published repo
options(repos = c(internally_published = "https://colorado.posit.co/rspm/published/__linux__/jammy/latest"))

install.packages("lisaPackageManagerDemo")
```

View the published package with: Published -\> Activity

Remove a package:

```{r}
remove.packages("lisaPackageManagerDemo")
```

Packages can be completely removed from package manager using the admin cli: <https://colorado.posit.co/rspm/__docs__/admin/appendix/cli/#rspm-remove>

Set it up to access multiple repositories (so we don't have to jump back and forth) with something like this:

```{r}
options(repos = c(
  RSPM = "https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/__linux__/jammy/latest",
  internally_published = "https://colorado.posit.co/rspm/published/__linux__/jammy/latest",
  snapshot_= "https://colorado.posit.co/rspm/published/__linux__/jammy/2022-11-17+rgbEPWyr",
  CRAN = "https://cloud.r-project.org"
))
```
